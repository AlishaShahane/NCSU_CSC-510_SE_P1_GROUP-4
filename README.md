## Problem Statement
Given a network of individuals, where the nodes represent people who can potentially infect others, determine whether it will rapidly spread througout the network or will it die out. The rate of propagation of a virus across the network will depend on the connectivity of the network and parameters like transmission probability, healing probability and vaccines available.

## Why would you want to choose our project??
#### Most relatable idea! 
This project will be helpful in predicting pandemics in future and applying measures to prevent the world from coming to a standstill. 
#### We come with solution!
And even if these simulations do actually result in a pandemic, we are suggesting immunization policies which might help to protect people from the infection and prevent further spread. 
#### Prerequisites
The great thing about this project is that you only need to know python to understand and further implement this project.
#### Phase 2 support
This project comes with a code stub and a very thorough documentation to help you guide through the second phase.

## Pending items for project completion
We have implemented one immunization policy. There are three more immunization policies yet to be implemented. [Code](https://github.com/rohanpillai20/NCSU_CSC-510_SE_P1_GROUP-4/tree/master/Code) lists the policies and how to implement them.
